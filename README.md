# QuaranScreen

QuaranScreen is a simple web app intended to reduce the endless streaming service scroll by displaying a random. Also, the user can search for a alcholic beverage to make the night better. It displays both movie result and drink into the box areas after clicking submit.

## Usage

If something is searched in the moive bar then it will make a call to the OMDb API and present the information from OMDb into the results section.

If a specific alcholic drink is searched then it will make a call to TheCocktailDb and that will present.

If the random button is clicked then it will display a randomized result into the result section.
